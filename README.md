EyePop interview coding challenge


## Notes
- Should have an option to close the helper codes on Dashboard so it would be easier for people to see all their available models and only upon clicking on it have it open up the helper code.

- PythonSDK docs could be more detailed and organized with headers and a table of contents.
- Also example code does not work/(not updated?)
- **Probably a bug?** but when parsing image3 one of my test run, it detected a "text" item but did not provide a "texts" list in the response.
